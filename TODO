1. Profile to find bottlenecks
2. Test straight draw() vs. make_cluster & draw()
3. default the logid/nodeid goto combo to selnode
4. struct flyby - then write out multiple structs for flyby
5. in capture.c, malloc is expensive, try to allocate all frames at once
   and reuse slots.
6. only perform node calculations on vmode swapping.  it's not like
   nodes move around during recompilations, so there is a lot of
   wasted math, especially if make_cluster() is being called frequently.
7. check invmap looks after nid gaps
8. add a fatal() function that is a wrapper over err() that breaks from
  the DB
9. goto new job
10. random flyby/cycle focus jobs
11. grey out non-select nodes
12. use colors from xt3 temperature png
13. wired pipes
14. draw frame around end of wired repeats
15. don't display service node partners
16. screenshot for poster
