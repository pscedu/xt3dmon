reminders:
- don't recompile things - do it once and only call the
  display lists if they are enabled (struct node.n_dl[2])
- add more info to the status panel
- clean up includes in files that do not need them
- keep globals few
- remove/split up mon.h
- ensure all fill get memset(0) now

maybe not:
- 'R' prefix keybinding to enable rebuild flags
- move the id into ohp instead of maintaing separate vars
- sigcatch USR1 to reload datasrc and pkill in cron
- flyby_writecam() 'camera moved' frame -> set RF_CAM?

todo
- default the logid goto user input buffer to selnode
- random flyby/cycle focus jobs
- try #define __inline to see if it does anything
- poll data files for when to refresh instead of blind refresh
- function to do rebuild option diffs
- be more intelligent about swapping between frustums in drawing
  stereo scenes (don't flip twice, just flip back and forth)
- move sticky to pinfo for persistence
- divide color wheel among all modes (free/down/disabled/etc)
  and probably keep these the same always
- (server mode) use overlay display cleanup of damaged glut win in
  generated screenshots
- kill nselnodes (if SLIST_EMPTY())
- cache the current selected stuff to check for short circuiting --
  if it follows the cursor, this should save on small movements
- find some way to alloc wi sel steps once
- in wione, draw the cube outer planes first, then inner, so gl
  tries to optimize
- handle SIGPIPES in server mode
- datasrc refresh code checks if the file is diff, so maybe the
  cronjob should check too?
- dsc chdir to avoid races
- make job searching bsearch again, since it is sorted
- show other things in the queue (other pbs queues)
- dynamic font widths
- make selnode drawing respect n_curv
- draw_node, if (hide) curv = *v
- introduce widim.iv_[whd] instead of WIDIM_WIDTH, etc.
- merge capture_copy*
- check that the server dsc-copies fresh data in case data is no
  longer automatically refreshing itself
- add recursive check to gl_run() to protect against that kind of
  invocation
- kill gl_run() -- have glutDisplayHandler for each win
- provide if-modified-since in http headers
- change date panel time code to update a global time var when new
  data is read (RF_DATASRC handling), don't grab current time in panel
  refresh function
- check/mkdir exists when access(/tmp/xtsess/xxx) fails
- add arg to getcol() to set the texids
- for tweening, calculate the % moved by one (e.g. move), then apply
  that % to the others, instead of use MAX_{LOOK,TWEEN} values
- bug when revolve position = st.st_v
- set st.st_mtime to HTTP response last-modified
- make select node glow/fade color?
- use a different font.png for matrix egg (katonese chars)
- move some stuff (like wioff) into 'struct state'
- kill the stopv stuff in key.c after OP_TWEEN is disabled during flybys
- remove some size_t's (pointer sizes)
- goto job by id
- make hl_job() that takes care of flyby recs
- kill PF_XPARENT and just set fill differently
- disappearing interactive panels needs to cleanup uinp
- view mode panels (wired/physical) with widgets
- remove hlsc from state, replace with flyby recs
- fix rebuild() st.st_rf mess
- change FF_ALPHA to FF_OPAQUE
- put ss file in double/flat format
- watch out for server mode, dmode=temp then setting hlnc
- add table for service node hostnames to ssh/command
- only redraw panels in the same stick after one is moved
- compile 1 node and just use Translate and calllist in selection
- merge gl and env files?
- stereo display handler runs in each window yet updates both, so
  remove to double performance
- make make_cluster just do NODE_FOREACH() draw, then in there do wireps
- dont use RF_INIT except in main.c
- reduce tween amt when fps is high
- cursors and flyby mode
- bring back option for SEL_GAP things
- in server, protect png_write from EPIPE when client disconnects/timeouts
- glTranslate won't stack, so fix wirep/make_selnode
- gl_run the cursor changes
- add flag to NODE_FOREACH for wired/physical ordered traversal (fix phys alpha problem)
- allow mouse wheel and +/- to adjust nc translucency
- kill draw_wired_frame
- bring back wired cluster frames? (VM_WIRED)
- if job fields are 0 in ninfo, don't print
- add panel reporting when new data is available
- fix textures in legend: draw above panel background
