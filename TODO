1. Profile to find bottlenecks
3. default the logid goto user input buffer to selnode
6. only perform node calculations on vmode swapping.  it's not like
   nodes move around during recompilations, so there is a lot of
   wasted math, especially if make_cluster() is being called frequently.
8. add a fatal() function that is a wrapper over err() that breaks from
  the DB
9. goto new job
10. random flyby/cycle focus jobs
12. use colors from xt3 temperature png
13. node id on texture or directly on node surface
    (ie. sides or front/back)
14. 'T' key binding must die. textures should be reloaded if
	they are turned on and blending changes. When blending
	is off, textures should have been loaded using GL_RGBA.
	When blending is on they are loaded with GL_INTENSITY.
