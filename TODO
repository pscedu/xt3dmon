reminders:
(o) don't recompile things - do it once and only call the
    display lists if they are enabled (struct node.n_dl[2])
(o) add more info to the status panel
(o) clean up includes in files that do not need them
(o) remove some globals
(o) remove/split up mon.h

maybe not:
(o) 'r' prefix keybinding to enable rebuild flags
(o) move the id into ohp instead of maintaing separate vars
(o) sigcatch USR1 and datasrc and pkill in cron

3. default the logid goto user input buffer to selnode
10. random flyby/cycle focus jobs
15. try #define __inline to see if it does anything
29. poll data files for when to refresh instead of blind refresh
34. function to do rebuild option diffs
39. be more intelligent about swapping between frustums in drawing
    stereo scenes (don't flip twice, just flip back and forth)
41. move sticky to pinfo for persistence
45. divide color wheel among all modes (free/down/disabled/etc)
    and probably keep these the same always
50. (server mode) use overlay display cleanup of damaged glut win in
    generated screenshots
51. kill nselnodes (if SLIST_EMPTY())
52. cache the current selected stuff to check for short circuiting --
    if it follows the cursor, this should save on small movements
53. find some way to alloc wi sel steps once
54. in wione, draw the cube outer planes first, then inner, so gl
    tries to optimize
55. handle SIGPIPES in server and client modes
56. datasrc refresh code checks if the file is diff, so maybe the
    cronjob should check too?
57. dsc chdir to avoid races
63. stereo selection mode
64. make job searching bsearch again, since it is sorted
66. show other things in the queue (other pbs queues)
67. dynamic font widths
69. make selnode drawing respect n_curv
70. draw_node, if (hide) curv = *v
72. cut physv setting each time VMODE_PHYS is set, to save fp calc
77. introduce widim.iv_[whd] instead of WIDIM_WIDTH, etc.
78. merge capture_copy*
79. merge win_width blah into ivec
80. merge hl_*all to hl_setall(1.0 vs. 0.0)
81. check that the server dsc-copies fresh data in case data is no
    longer automatically refreshing itself
82. add recursive check to gl_run() to protect against that kind of
    invocation
83. kill gl_run() -- have glutDisplayHandler for each win
84. provide if-modified-since in http headers
85. change date panel time code to update a global time var when new
    data is read, not update the time in the panel refresh function
87. check/mkdir exists when touch(/tmp/xtsess/xxx) fails
89. add arg to getcol() to set the texids
90. for tweening, calculate the % moved by one (e.g. move), then apply
    that % to the others, instead of use MAX_{LOOK,TWEEN} values
91. bug when revolve position = st.st_v
92. set st.st_mtime to HTTP response last-modified
93. make select node glow/fade color?
