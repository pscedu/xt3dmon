reminders:
- recompile GL lists as minimally as possible
- add more info to the status panel
- clean up includes in files that do not need them
- fewer globals
- remove/split up mon.h
- ensure all 'struct fill' locals get memset(0) now
- don't use continue/break/etc. in WIREP/NODE_FOREACH
- dont use RF_INIT except in main.c
- remove some size_t's (pointer sizes)
- delint
- ensure nothing modifies st.st_opt and uses opt_flip() instead
- use recent libpng/libz/freeglut/openssl on win32

maybe not:
- keybinding to enable rebuild flags
- move the id into ohp instead of maintaing separate vars
- (server mode) sigcatch USR1 to reload datasrc and pkill in cron
- flyby_writecam() 'camera moved' frame -> set RF_CAM?
- compile node/nodeclass draw lists?
- default the logid goto user input buffer to selnode
- kill nselnodes (if SLIST_EMPTY())

bs
- add arg to getcol() to set the texids
- function to do rebuild option diffs
- (server mode) use overlay display cleanup of damaged glut win in
  generated screenshots
- in draw_node(), if (!show) n_curv = *v

todo
- tourjob mode - use captions
- try #define __inline to see if it does anything
- poll data files for when to refresh instead of blind refresh
- provide if-modified-since in http headers to avoid extra work on
- divide color wheel among all modes (free/down/disabled/etc)
  and probably keep these the same always
- selection shouldn't start from the top down each time; it should
  start from pretty much where it left off last time and go from
  bottom to the top (and at each level back down)
- find some way to alloc wi sel steps once
- in wione, draw the cube outer planes first, then inner, so gl
  tries to optimize
- handle SIGPIPES in server mode (png_write when client disconnects/timeouts)
- datasrc refresh code checks if the file is diff, so maybe the
  cronjob should check too?
- dsc chdir to avoid races
- show other things in the queue (other pbs queues)
- support variable font widths/antialiased fonts
- leverage ftgl in panel character drawing
- check that the server dsc-copies fresh data in case data is no
  longer automatically refreshing itself
- add recursive check to gl_run() to protect against that kind of
  invocation
  update intervals when no new data is available/check for new data
- fix crash when revolve position = st.st_v
- make select node glow/fade color?
- use a different font.png for matrix egg (katonese chars)
- kill PIF_XPARENT and just set fill differently
- implement FF_OPAQUE everywhere
- watch out for server mode, dmode=temp then setting hl=free
- finish send-command-to-login-node-panel
- merge gl and env files?
- bring back option for SEL_GAP things
- use NODE_FOREACH_PHYS to fix physvmode alpha problem
- add panel reporting when new data is available
- vec_rotate() is busted for large amounts
- rename NODEWIDTH/HEIGHT/DEPTH cause its phys-only
- kill job_findbyid, just use obj_get with a flag that prevents creation
- make job searching bsearch again, since it is sorted
- add subtitle for when the machine is down
- add cam_refocus() and factor the code out of cam_revolve()
- add "extended help" panel -- contents description get updated on each item moused over
- modify the pipe code to determine absolute points based on
	(node->n_wiv + wioff) * winsp
  instead of using node->n_v at all
	- disadvantage: won't work when nodes are moving
- need a way in the script files to report a problem with the
  data fetch script cannot do there job -- when getting data fails,
  set_caption("ssh connection to phantom prohibited?") won't work,
  but we got to say something (in the data files)
- add a caption timer to prevent captions from being changed so
  often that they flicker (in the case during a reel playback, e.g.)
- make the focus point an SLIST
- replace spkeys with retrieval/cache function
- use epoll to in server to avoid many sleep wakeups
- check dsc_clone to ensure that a new file is created even if master
  is empty (open() ... close() with no intervening write())
- when the xtwmon server is down, it still creates session files,
  whereas the xt3dmon server is unable, creating the anomaly of
  no files
- rename POPT_REFRESH to POPT_REDRAW, POPT_DIRTY to POPT_REBUILD
- moving the cursor should not cause panel recompiles
- use buf.c routines in base64 routines instead of bufsize guesswork
- only flag RF_CLUSTER on sn_remove() when the node to remove is at the
  front of the list (it otherwise won't need to be rebuilt)
- text_wrap has a bug:
	char buf[BUFSIZ] = "yod -size 3072 -small_pages -stack 8000000 /usr/users/8/quinnt/src/pkdgrav/gasoline.noiob -wall 460 drgas.param";
	text_wrap(buf, 40)
- don't glEnable(POLYGON_SMOOTH) blindly, it makes the underlying triangles
  visible
- remove SPF_PROBE and replace with different callback
	- XXX remove callback entirely?
- investigate MGL for X-less OpenGL for server mode
- change cursors depending on selection activity

xtwmon
- rename arbiter-raw.pl?data=nodes to data=node

tweening
- fix tween to real stack: once point is reached, pop it then move on
	problem: the camera will speed up then slow down to reach the
	first state, then speed up and slow down to reach the second,
	etc. and jerk around instead of being smooth when there are
	multiple tween positions on the tween stack
- increase tween limit when fps is high, or when "stack" contains many layers
- use vec_rotate() instead of fractional values for up/look when spinning around
	- ensure tweening leaves normalized vectors
- for tweening, calculate the % moved by one (e.g. move), then apply
  that % to the others, instead of use MAX_{LOOK,TWEEN} values
