1. Profile to find bottlenecks
3. default the logid goto user input buffer to selnode
6. only perform node calculations on vmode swapping.  it's not like
   nodes move around during recompilations, so there is a lot of

9. goto new job
10. random flyby/cycle focus jobs
12. use colors from xt3 temperature png
