reminders:
- recompile GL lists as minimally as possible
- add more info to the status panel
- clean up includes in files that do not need them
- keep globals few
- remove/split up mon.h
- ensure all 'struct fill' locals get memset(0) now
- don't use continue/break/etc. in WIREP/NODE_FOREACH
- dont use RF_INIT except in main.c
- remove some size_t's (pointer sizes)

maybe not:
- keybinding to enable rebuild flags
- move the id into ohp instead of maintaing separate vars
- sigcatch USR1 to reload datasrc and pkill in cron
- flyby_writecam() 'camera moved' frame -> set RF_CAM?
- compile node/nodeclass draw lists?
- default the logid goto user input buffer to selnode
- kill nselnodes (if SLIST_EMPTY())

bs
- make selnode drawing respect n_curv
- add arg to getcol() to set the texids
- function to do rebuild option diffs

todo
- tourjob mode
- try #define __inline to see if it does anything
- poll data files for when to refresh instead of blind refresh
- divide color wheel among all modes (free/down/disabled/etc)
  and probably keep these the same always
- (server mode) use overlay display cleanup of damaged glut win in
  generated screenshots
- cache the current selected stuff to check for short circuiting --
  if it follows the cursor, this should save on small movements
- find some way to alloc wi sel steps once
- in wione, draw the cube outer planes first, then inner, so gl
  tries to optimize
- handle SIGPIPES in server mode (png_write when client disconnects/timeouts)
- datasrc refresh code checks if the file is diff, so maybe the
  cronjob should check too?
- dsc chdir to avoid races
- make job searching bsearch again, since it is sorted
- show other things in the queue (other pbs queues)
- dynamic font widths
- draw_node, if (!show) curv = *v
- introduce widim.iv_[whd] instead of WIDIM_WIDTH, etc.
- check that the server dsc-copies fresh data in case data is no
  longer automatically refreshing itself
- add recursive check to gl_run() to protect against that kind of
  invocation
- provide if-modified-since in http headers
- change date panel time code to update a global time var when new
  data is read (RF_DATASRC handling), don't grab current time in panel
  refresh function
- check/mkdir exists when access(/tmp/xtsess/xxx) fails
- for tweening, calculate the % moved by one (e.g. move), then apply
  that % to the others, instead of use MAX_{LOOK,TWEEN} values
- fix crash when revolve position = st.st_v
- set st.st_mtime to HTTP response last-modified
- make select node glow/fade color?
- use a different font.png for matrix egg (katonese chars)
- kill PF_XPARENT and just set fill differently
- kill st_hlsc add highlight flyby recs
- implement FF_OPAQUE everywhere
- watch out for server mode, dmode=temp then setting hlnc
- add table for service node hostnames to ssh/command
- merge gl and env files?
- bring back option for SEL_GAP things
- add flag to NODE_FOREACH for wired/physical ordered traversal (fix phys alpha problem)
- if job fields are 0 in ninfo, don't print
- add panel reporting when new data is available
- fix textures in legend: draw above panel background
- make status panels contents queue, remove in due time
- vec_rotate() is busted for large amounts
- on mac/win32, fix node labels on solid node colors
- fix tween to real stack: once point is reached, pop it then move on
- increase tween limit when fps is high, or when "stack" contains many layers
- rename NODEWIDTH/HEIGHT/DEPTH cause its phys-only
- add copyright stuff (glut, zlib, etc.) to xt3dmon.1
- use existing kerberos tickets to do auth
- ensure tweening leaves normalized vectors
- kill job_findbyid, just use obj_get with a flag that prevents creation
- bird eye: respect winsp and maybe wioff
- add to help: goto bird's eye, print selnode ids
- rename HL_* to NC_*
