xt3dmon - 3-d OpenGL Cray XT3 monitor
=====================================

This C program loads datasets from the management database of Cray XT3 systems
into a 3-d environment that can be used to correlate data in a visual
representation of both the physical and wiring/network topology of a system.

In order to load datasets, the management information must be extracted into a
format xt3dmon understands.  The scripts in the "tools" directory can be used
to generate this data.  The tools/update.sh script is mainly in charge of this
and has configuration parameters it loads from the top of the file as well as
from the cfg-* files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

  - OpenSSL (if capability is needed to access XT3 management data over the Web)
  - GSSAPI (if needed to authenticate for data over the Web)
  - OpenGL
  - GLUT (freeglut works well on Win32 and Linux)
  - libpng
  - gmake
  - a compiler such as gcc

To build for Linux, run "make".

To build for Mac OS X, navigate to arch/macosx and open the xt3dmon Xcode
project file.

To build for Windows, navigate to arch/win32 and open the xt3dmon Visual Studio
project.
